## About

Iâ€™m a front-end web developer with over a decade of experience. I work with agencies across the globe to create high performance & rich interactive websites that work across all platforms & devices.

Although I'm very familiar with using frameworks, my websites are primarily hand-coded using HTML5, CSS3, SVG & JavaScript.

With a strong emphasis on "Progressive Enhancement", I look for creative ways to push the boundaries of website front-end code without compromising on browser support and performance.

In a quest for always keeping myself updated, I read books and attend conferences & meetups.
